Using the Flex components, here are some helpful shorthand props:

- `flexDirection` is `direction`
- `flexWrap` is `wrap`
- `flexBasis` is `basis`
- `flexGrow` is `grow`
- `flexShrink` is `shrink`
- `alignItems` is `align`
- `justifyContent` is `justify`

While you can pass the verbose props, using the shorthand can save you some
time.
